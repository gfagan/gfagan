            <p>
              Data recording in the field, particularly in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage Management, still tends to be done using paper record sheets. Numerous attempts have been made to ‘digitise’ the recording process, but the efforts so far have either been unwieldy, expensive, or simply a digital version of a paper recording sheet. 

            </p>

           <p> Phoenix Heritage, our Industry Partner,  proposed a Smartphone/Tablet-based recording system, linked to a database in the cloud or on a local server, and driven by onscreen prompts for more efficient data gathering and recording.

            <p> Phoenix Heritage is a technology consultancy involved in the development of innovative hardware devices and software applications for the Heritage Industry.</p>

            <h1 class="header">Some Context</h1>

            <p>
              For our Final Project, we were assigned into groups and given a project proposal from one of Digital Skills Academy’s Industry partners. 
            </p>
            <p>Our Industry Partner (IP) was Phoenix Heritage, a technology consultancy involved in the development of innovative hardware devices and software applications for the Heritage Industry</p>
            <p>
              Our project team, which was internationally based, we named Azteca, keeping in line with the archaeology and historical nature of our IP. Once we had the team name, I created the below logo.

            <p>
              Data recording in the field, particularly in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage Management, still tends to be done using paper record sheets. Numerous attempts have been made to ‘digitise’ the recording process, but the efforts so far have either been unwieldy, expensive, or simply a digital version of a paper recording sheet. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Some excavations have 20000+ pieces of record that are fragmented, requiring recruitment of resources to manually input, and overall can be time-consuming, costly and have duplication of effort.

            </p>

            <p>Field Notes is a solution being developed by Phoenix Heritage in response to that. They are looking to digitise the laborious manual record gathering and management process involved in a standard archaeological dig, which to-date still involve only paper record sheets. Phoenix Heritage looked to Team Azteca to gather enough material to provide a product proof of concept for Field Notes, that could be presented to potential investors.

          <h1 class="header">My Role</h1>

          <p>
            We had a team of five committed to the application of Agile Methodologies, for which I was the UX Designer. My responsibility was to focus primarily on the user research and prototyping aspect of the project. 

          </p>
          <p>
           
          The other project roles were as follows: 
          </p>
            
          <ul>
            <li>Project Manager </li>
            <li>Scrum Master</li>
            <li>Marketing & Business Analyst </li>
            <li>Developer </li>
          </ul>

          <p>From Phoenix Heritage we also had Stuart, the company's founder, who acted as their representative thorughout the process. Stuart is an experienced and licensed Senior Archaeologist with over 30 years of professional consultancy experience. </p>

          <h1 class="header">Identifying Early Challenges</h1>
  
          <p>
              At our first team meeting, we put together a team charter and identified some non-technical challenges that we would need to take into account. 
          </p>
        
          <ol>
            <li>Our project team was split between two time zones, with three members being in Ireland and the other two living in Dubai. </li>
            <li>All team members had a full time job.</li>
            <li>A relatively quick turnaround in terms of the project timelines was required, especially considering we also had multiple video presentation assessments to be produced in conjunction with deliverables for the Industry Partner. </li>
            <li>Getting time with other archaeologists and potential app users outside of Stuart would be incredibly difficult considering the circumstances. </li>

          </ol>
          <p>To offset having a globally set team, we relied heavily on digital applications, such as Whatsapp, Trello, and Google Hangouts, Drive and Calendar.
            </p>

            <p>With time restrictions in mind, we set ourselves a weekly time slot for our team meeting, and a bi-weekly slot for a catch-up with our Industry Partner.</p>

       </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h1 class="header">Setting the Scope</h1>

        <p>
            After the team was established and we had received the project proposal, we arranged a meeting with Stuart to carry out a deep dive of the initial brief to begin identifying the project’s deliverables, determining what was possible with respect to the time, cost and quality available to us.
