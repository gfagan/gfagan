              Data recording in the field, particularly in Archaeology and
              Cultural Heritage Management, still tends to be done using paper
              record sheets. Numerous attempts have been made to ‘digitise’ the
              recording process, but the efforts so far have either been
              unwieldy, expensive, or simply a digital version of a paper
              recording sheet.

              Phoenix Heritage, our Industry Partner, proposed a
              Smartphone/Tablet-based recording system, linked to a database in
              the cloud or on a local server, and driven by onscreen prompts for
              more efficient data gathering and recording.

              Our project team, which was internationally based, we named
              Azteca, keeping in line with the archaeology and historical nature

            <p>
              Data recording in the field, particularly in Archaeology and
              Cultural Heritage Management, still tends to be done using paper
              record sheets. Numerous attempts have been made to ‘digitise’ the
              recording process, but the efforts so far have either been
              unwieldy, expensive, or simply a digital version of a paper
              recording sheet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some excavations have 20000+ pieces of record that are fragmented,
              requiring recruitment of resources to manually input, and overall
              can be time-consuming, costly and have duplication of effort.
            </p>

            <p>
              Field Notes is a solution being developed by Phoenix Heritage in
              response to that. They are looking to digitise the laborious
              manual record gathering and management process involved in a
              standard archaeological dig, which to-date still involve only
              paper record sheets. Phoenix Heritage looked to Team Azteca to
              gather enough material to provide a product proof of concept for
              Field Notes, that could be presented to potential investors.

              We had a team of five committed to the application of Agile
              Methodologies, for which I was the UX Designer. My responsibility
              was to focus primarily on the user research and prototyping aspect
              of the project.
            </p>
            <p>The other project roles were as follows:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Project Manager</li>
              <li>Scrum Master</li>

            </ul>

            <p>
              From Phoenix Heritage we also had Stuart, the company's founder,
              who acted as their representative thorughout the process. Stuart
              is an experienced and licensed Senior Archaeologist with over 30

            <h1 class="header">Identifying Early Challenges</h1>

            <p>
              At our first team meeting, we put together a team charter and
              identified some non-technical challenges that we would need to
              take into account.
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Our project team was split between two time zones, with three
                members being in Ireland and the other two living in Dubai.
              </li>
              <li>All team members had a full time job.</li>
              <li>
                A relatively quick turnaround in terms of the project timelines
                was required, especially considering we also had multiple video
                presentation assessments to be produced in conjunction with
                deliverables for the Industry Partner.
              </li>
              <li>
                Getting time with other archaeologists and potential app users
                outside of Stuart would be incredibly difficult considering the
                circumstances.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              To offset having a globally set team, we relied heavily on digital
              applications, such as Whatsapp, Trello, and Google Hangouts, Drive
              and Calendar.
            </p>

            <p>
              With time restrictions in mind, we set ourselves a weekly time
              slot for our team meeting, and a bi-weekly slot for a catch-up
              with our Industry Partner.
            </p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-12">
            <h1 class="header">Setting the Scope</h1>

            <p>
              After the team was established and we had received the project
              proposal, we arranged a meeting with Stuart to carry out a deep
              dive of the initial brief to begin identifying the project’s
              deliverables, determining what was possible with respect to the
              time, cost and quality available to us.
            </p>

            <p>
              Following this first meeting with Stuart, I arranged a separate
              meeting in order to carry out some research and define the user
              requirements. This meeting between helped lay the foundation for
              our personas, as well as outlining some key items for
              consideration, such as the poor lighting conditions and potential
              lack of phone data reception that archaeologists may be faced with
              when on site.
            </p>

            <p>
              It was from this discussion that we settled on there being no
              requirement for company branding, or a high-fidelity prototype and
              accompanying style guide. Instead, we agreed on the delivery of a
              high level information architecture, wireframes, and a
              low-fidelity prototype.
            </p>

            <p>
              Following this, we produced a scope document outlining the project
              at hand, the scope of work and what was out of scope, as well as
              the projected timelines, tasks and costs.
            </p>
            <p>
              To summarise, we set ourselves the following deliverables to be
              achieved over four two-week sprint cycles:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                A <b>Marketing Plan</b>, to include a marketing strategy and
                plan, as well as a competitor analysis.
              </li>
              <li>
                A <b>UX Design</b>, following initial user research into
                personas and scenarios and resolting in an information
                architecture diagram.
              </li>
              <li>
                A <b>UI Design</b> in the form of wireframes of the office admin
                user's dashboard, and wireframes and a low fidelity prototype of
                the archaeologist user's app view.
              </li>
              <li>
                A <b>Technology Roadmap</b>, including a backend architecture
                diagram, some cloud storage solution comparisons, and a product
                roadmap.
              </li>
              <li>Some <b>Usability Testing</b> on potential end-users.</li>
              <li>
                A <b>Project Closure Report</b> document, to formalise the
                closure of the project, outlining the criteria for deliverable
                acceptance.

            <h1 class="header">Project Journey - Sprint 0</h1>

            <p>
              The main methodology used for this project was agile. The team’s
              scrum master worked on the timelines and tasks required to produce
              the deliverables. Armed with clear deliverables, we managed our
              work using Agile, and broke the timeline down into four 2 weeks
              Sprints.
            </p>

            <p>
              We documented each of our Sprints in terms of plans, reviews and
              retrospectives and these were shared with our Industry Partner at
              the start, midway point, and end of each sprint. This helped
              ensure transparency and maintain alignment of direction.
            </p>

            <p>
              As archaeology was a new area of focus for the entire team, we
              were reliant on Stuart to give us background on the need for the
              solution he was looking to develop. Our Scrum Master had
              experience as a digital product owner in her professional life,
              and she used these insights to develop a product canvas based on
              both Stuart’s knowledge and the findings of the team. This was a
              very powerful tool that helped us to identify the key elements of
              the application.
            </p>

            <div class="row text-center">
              <div class="col-md-12 pb-4">

              </div>
            </div>

            <p>
              Our marketing analyst carried out competitor research,
              investigating other software or applications already in the market
              with any semblance to our project. This search gave us some
              valuable insights and armed with these, we were able to bring
              these to Stuart and work out in greater detail what success looks
              like for his solution.
            </p>

            <p>
              With all this information we started to developed a Marketing Plan
              that will help Phoenix Heritage to create awareness and
              commercialise. Within the Marketing Plan is included the the
              competitor analysis and also the designing of a target audience, 3
              personas with their user stories, marketing objectives, channels,
              KPI per channel, measurement tools and a strategy summary with all
              the info needed to developed the plan. The Marketing plan was a
              work in progress during Sprint 0, 1 and 2. Working directly with
              Stuart and his feedback along the way.
            </p>

            <p>
              My focus during Sprint 0 was the UX Requirements, which I’ve
              already discussed. Further to those discussions with Stuart, I
              also read up on best practices around user input and form design
              as I knew that this would be a key aspect of the Field Notes
              application.

            <p>
              In this sprint, our Developer began putting together a technology
              roadmap document. Here, she laid out the back-end app
              architecture, as well as the languages recommended to be used for
              each section of the software's development.

            <p>
              It also provided Phoenix Heritage with a breakdown of comparisons
              of cloud storage solution options, as well as our recommendations
              for the best road forward for them in terms of data storage
              architecture. Inclusive in the document was a Product Roadmap that
              detailed the next 12 months of their development of the Field

              to expected content and functionality in order to determine the
              key screens for Field Notes. Ultimately, Field Notes is a data
              input application relative to Archaeology Excavations, and the
              context sheets and record sheets that are produced from these.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first draft of the Information Architecture, as displayed
              below, combined functionality for both the Regular User and the
              Admin User. After presenting this to Stuart and getting his
              feedback, I split this into two separate architectures and we
              decided to provide Admin functionality through Desktop only.

              Above you can see the Mobile application, which contains only
              functionality for the regular user. On the right, we have the
              Desktop Information Architecture, and it is here where the Admin
              functionality comes to life.
            </p>
            <p>
              The complete separation of the Admin functionality from the Fields
              Notes application gives Stuart exactly what he was looking,
              something that is simple, straightforward, and easy to use.

            <p>
              With the Information Architecture settled upon, I started mocking
              up Wireframes using InVision Freehand. This allowed me to rapidly
              produce the displayed low-fidelity screens, receive feedback, and
              make amendments with ease.
            </p>
            <p>
              With our Personas in mind, I knew that we had to create an
              application that was both intuitive and informative to the users,
              catering for the young tech savvy Archaeologist who is a little
              unsure of the recording process, and the elder experienced
              Archaeologist who is a little uncomfortable with technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              With Stuarts direction and feedback, this let to the single input
              system that you can see here.

              I coupled this with contextual help for every field, and also a
              progress bar that details where along the input process the user
              is.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Wireframes for the Desktop Admin screens were also produced
              using InVision Freehand. Again, having the Information
              Architecture complete at this point was a massive help, as it
              allowed me to quickly think of the best way of structuring the
              content in a manner that both allows for a great user experience,
              but also is future proofed for Stuart and Phoenix heritage as they
              move forward in this process.
            </p>
            <p>
              This led to the tile system that you see below, which I believe is
              also consistent with the landing screen of the Android
              Application.

            <p>
              In the next image, the screen on the right shows a simple table
              view of all the contextual sheets that have been uploaded for
              their Excavation. It is here that the Admin is provisioned with
              the functionality to Edit the context sheets or upload associated
              drawings, two requirements that will be key for Fields Notes going
              forward.

              We also have the Excavation creation screen, displayed next.
              Again, I applied a “Don’t make me think” approach to this, with a
              goal to make it as simple as possible for the user.

              I broke the form up into three sections, Site Details, Location

              “Create Site” centered at the bottom of the form. The site members
              section allows the Admin to type in the email addresses of the
              users he wishes to grant access to.

            <p>
              After I had completed the finalised version of the wireframes,
              work was due to begin on a low-fidelity prototype using PhotoShop
              and InVision. However, due to an unforeseen increased workload in
              my dayjob, it was instead decided at the beginning of sprint 3
              that our Developer would instead create the prototype using the
              Bootstrap framework instead. Using the wireframes that I created
              in Sprint 2 as her guides, our Dev put together a full
              low-fidelity Bootstrap prototype.
            </p>

            <p>
              As and when deliverables were completed, we formalised reviews and
              the project acceptance process with Stuart, referencing our scope
              document and providing him opportunity to formally sign off our
              work.
