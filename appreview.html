            <p>
              I have been the UX Designer on this project, assisting with the
              Research, Analysis and Workshops, whilst also being solely
              responsible for the wireframing and prototype deliverables.

            <h1 class="header">Research</h1>

            <p>
              We started by carrying out six immersion sessions, where we
              shadowed over 25 users in their day-to-day use of the system,
              before following this up with individual user interviews.
            </p>
            <p>
              For each user, we recorded what they were doing, saying, the
              pain-points they encountered, and any insights we had. Further to
              this, we also reviewed the existing collateral and carried out an
              evaluation of the application's UI.
            </p>
            <p>From all of this, we outlined the following:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Three main user groups</li>
              <li>Seventy five pain-points</li>
              <li>Five focus areas</li>
              <li>Seven design priorities</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              From the user groups, my colleagues created three matching
              personas. I then set about creating a User Journeys for each one
              to be demoed back to the user groups as part of their group
              specific workshops.

            <h1 class="header">Pain-point Evaluation</h1>

            <p>
              The pain-points established from our user research helped us
              identify, from the user’s perspective, where frustrations were
              being encountered.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Digital Transformation Consultant on our team carried out a
              pain-point mapping exercise to firstly validate that our focus
              areas were correct, and secondly to highlight which areas had the
              greatest allocation of pain-points.
            </p>
            <p>
              My colleague also broke the pain-points up into associated
              categories, such as Functionality, Information Architecture, and
              Training, providing us with a holistic and more digestible view of
              the issues at hand.

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-12">
            <h1 class="header">Workshops</h1>

            <p>
              We played back our As-Is findings to each user group in their own
              specific workshop, discussing with them the five focus area we had
              identified, and empathising with their user journey and the
              pain-points that we had recorded.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Workshops were also used to co-create the To-Be user journeys
              for each group, were the users helped us map out their ideal
              scenario with the use of post-it notes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prototyping was also carried out by the users, helping us get an
              idea of how the wished certain flows or screens to be laid out.
            </p>
            <p>
              As some of the user feedback we had received was in relation to
              screens being cluttered with non-important information, or
              mandatory validations being required on unnecessary fields, we
              carried out a field prioritisation task. This allowed users to
              rank the fields in terms of importance, and highlight the
              mandatory fields that they wished to alter.

            <p>
              With all the information we had collected to date, I began
              prototyping the To-Be application, arranging user feedback
              sessions along the way in an effort to maintain our co-creation
              ethos and keeping users as involved in the process as their time
              allowed.
            </p>
            <p>
              At this stage we had began to identify a potential requirement to
              migrate the application from its current technology stack in order
              to provide the user with the full functionality that they
              required.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result, we identified immediate enhancements that could be
              made within the existing application framework, forming the basis
              of one prototype which looked namely at improving the overall
              Information Architecture of the application, the user flows, and
              reducing steps were possible within the system’s limitations. This
              prototype I developed in Axure in high-fidelity, based on the
              existing User Interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also generated a second prototype, of low to medium fideltiy, to
              display the future state for a key focus area - Search. Here I
              looked to maximise our understanding of the issues the users
              faced, empathising with their need for the following:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Simplified Search screen</li>
              <li>Multiple Tabs</li>
              <li>Ability to cross reference and multitask.</li>
