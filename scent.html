              To identify a potential start-up application idea and generate the
              necessary start-up branding content, such as a Logo and Brand

            <h1 class="header">Needfinding</h1>

            <p>
              I began by undertaking a needfinding process whereby I allowed
              myself a time period of around two weeks to look for any pain
              points that I experienced in daily living during that time, and
              from that, determined whether an application or product could be
              created to help resolve the matter hand.
            </p>

            <p>
              One of the ideas that I contemplated during this time included a
              musical keyboard that would help user’s learn how to play songs by
              providing visual feedback to the user, highlighting what keys to
              press in tandem with the song of the user’s choice.
            </p>

            <p>
              Another was an application that provided for a one-stop-shop when
              it came to booking and paying appointments, ranging from
              restaurants to hairdressers. This would also allow for the
              automatic splitting of bills between users.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ultimately, I started to find that the ideas that excited me most
              were more in the line of applications that took advantage of the
              camera in your phone and allowed user’s to get instant feedback
              about an item or service upon scanning it with their phone. This
              was largely inspired by the fantastic application, Vivino, which
              provides users with wine ratings and reviews whenever a wine
              label, or wine menu, is scanned. I believe the potential in this
              type of service is endless, and could be used to provide feedback
              and ratings on anything from clothes to food
            </p>

            <p>
              But the product that appealed to me the most, and I believe would
              be extremely beneficial to the market, is a perfume and cologne
              scanner. When wandering through the airport duty free and being
              greeted by endless rows of fragrances, I would love to be able to
              simply scan the label of one or many of the bottles and instantly
              get some information about a product, it’s community rating, user
              reviews, the average cost, the type of scent that can be expected,
              and ability to provide my own rating or review.
