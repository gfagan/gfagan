            <h1 class="header">Needfinding</h1>

            <p>
              I began by undertaking a needfinding process whereby I allowed
              myself a time period of around two weeks to look for any pain
              points that I experienced in daily living during, and from that,
              determined whether an application or product could be created to
              help resolve the matter hand.
            </p>

            <p>
              One of the ideas that I contemplated included a musical keyboard
              that would help user’s learn how to play songs by providing visual
              feedback to the user, highlighting what keys to press in tandem
              with the song of the user’s choice.
            </p>

            <p>
              Another was an application that provided for a one-stop-shop when
              it came to booking and paying appointments, ranging from
              restaurants to hairdressers. This would also allow for the
              automatic splitting of bills between users.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ultimately, I started to find that the ideas that excited me most
              were more in the line of applications that took advantage of the
              camera in your phone and allowed user’s to get instant feedback
              about an item or service upon scanning it with their phone. This
              was largely inspired by the fantastic application, Vivino, which
              provides users with wine ratings and reviews whenever a wine
              label, or wine menu, is scanned. I believe the potential in this
              type of service is endless, and could be used to provide feedback
              and ratings on anything from clothes to food
            </p>

            <p>
              But the product that appealed to me the most, and I believe would
              be extremely beneficial to the market, is a perfume and cologne
              scanner. When wandering through the airport duty free and being
              greeted by endless rows of fragrances, I would love to be able to
              simply scan the label of one or many of the bottles and instantly
              get some information about the product, it’s community rating,
              user reviews, the average cost, the type of scent that can be
              expected, and ability to provide my own rating or review.

              Mindmap - Name - Logo Ideas - Draft 1 - Moodboard - Finalised Logo
            </p>
            <p>
              I decided that the name of my product would be ‘Scent’, this was
              largely due to the close word association involved with perfumes
              and colognes. I had originally narrowed it down to either that, or
              ‘Fragrance’, but I knew that I wanted to use the word fragrance in
              the description of the product, most noticeably in the banner
              adverts where I would inform users the Scent was a mobile
              fragrance scanner. In hindsight, whilst I am happy with the name,
              I should have taken a more expansive thinking view on this, rather
              than almost immediately having it down to two names in my mind and
              making a decision based solely on that.
            </p>

            <p>
              I followed this up by carrying out a Mindmap excercise, which is
              where you write a central topic on a page and then add any related
              words or phrases that come to mind, expanding on each word or
              phrase until all possible associations are noted. When I began my
              mindmap, I already had decided upon the name. Ideally, the
              decision on the name would have waited until after this
              mindmapping exercise was properly completed, at which point I
              would, in theory, have had a wider list of associated words to
              choose from, and the potential for another name idea to appear in
              the future would be greatly diminished. Nevertheless, it was a
              good lesson learned.
            </p>

            <p>
              Following on from the mindmap, I began sketching out some image
              associations, with much the same thought process behind the word
              mindmapping. Here I focused on perfume and cologne bottles, their
              different shapes, and how I could somehow incorporate something of
              this nature into my designs.

            <h1 class="header">Prototyping & Initial Feedback</h1>

            <p>
              One of the things that constantly played on my mind when trying to
              decide on a logo for Scent, was the need for it to suit not only
              perfumes and aftershaves, but also the wide range of products and
              styles within these. My thought process was that I needed the keep
              the design somewhat neutral in terms of its color scheme and
              typography as a result.
            </p>

            <p>
              I started off with a muted blue colour scheme, but quickly found
              this to be too bland. My desire was to achieve branding that
              tailors to the fragrance industry, but also on the type the
              company I would want Scent to be, and the image I would want to
              portray. With this in my mind, I ended up with arriving at the
              below color swatch.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row text-center">
          <div class="col-md-12">
            <img src="/img/color1.png" alt="" class="img-fluid" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="pt-4">
          The orange is a warm colour that helps bring a spark of energy to the
          branding. The purple tailors towards the wealthy and regal angle that
          many of the uppermost fragrance brands evoke. The coolness of the
          colour I think works very well in contrast to the orange. The green,
          whilst being a little vibrant, brings the notion of sophistication to
          the brand, and is also often associated with wealth. The red provides
          some passion to the branding, whilst also being muted enough to avoid
          dominating the colour scheme. Blue typically promotes trustworthiness,
          and helps provide an image that is responsible and calm. The selection
          of colours really helps Scent represent the extremely diverse and
          nuanced fragrance market, with the slightly pastel aspect of the
          scheme preventing from any one of the colours dominating too much and
          evoking the wrong image.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the swatch had been decided upon, I then created a scrapbook
          Illustrator file whereby I created multiple variations of the logo, as
          shown below.
        </p>

        <div class="row text-center">
          <div class="col-md-12 pb-4">
            <img src="/img/scrapbook.png" alt="" class="img-fluid" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          My initial fear was that there was perhaps a little too much going on
          with the logo. One of my biggest concerns was that the ‘S’ was not
          prominent enough, and that the desire to incorporate the perfume spray
          into the composition of this was ultimately not feasible, at least not
          in this draft.
        </p>

        <p>
          This was confirmed when discussing the matter with my friends, work
          colleagues, and team members from other Digital Skills Academy
          projects. The idea was nice, but the execution was not.
        </p>

        <p>
          I went back to the drawing board, still intent on having a very
          visible tie to perfume or cologne in the Scent logo, and arrived at
          the below design.
        </p>

        <div class="row text-center">
          <div class="col-md-12 pb-4">
            <img id="scent1" src="/img/scent1.png" alt="" class="img-fluid" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          With the reworked design I decided to stick to purple as the primary
          colour, and reserve the secondary colours for the faint perfume
          bubbles in the background. The perfume bottle I removed, instead
          introducing a nozzle on the of the C, and utlising the letters rounded
          shape in conjunction with the gestalt closure principle. A subtle
          touch, but with the intention being to reduce the noise of the
          previous design, I was far happier with this iteration.
        </p>

        <p>
          The feedback I received from my peers, colleagues and friends this
          time around was far more positive, with the general impression being
          that this was a more professional and polished logo. However, when it
          came time for me to progress with the deliverables of this assignment,
          I found that I was running into stumbling blocks with regards to the
          shape, spacing and overall style of the logo. The ‘S’ being comprised
          of the fragrance bubbles again led to weak prominence, meaning that it
          couldn’t be used for standalone branding. The more I tweaked the
          design and thought about it’s application in both the brand guidelines
          and application screens for Scent, the more I distanced myself from
          the design.

            <p>
              I decided to go back to basics and create a moodboard using
              InVision’s Boards. I quickly jotted down a mindmap on paper,
              pulling in all the words I could think of that related to the
              creation of fragrances. My focus was on the core ingredients and
              the true essence of fragrance making.
            </p>

            <p>
              Following this, I went on Google Image search and saved any image
              that took my fancy based on the keywords that the mindmap
              produced. Once I had these all pulled into an InVision Board, as
              shown below, it was clear to me that I should focus more on the
              ingredient, flower based angle for the Logo design, and not just
              the fragrance bottle and spray. I quickly built a colour palette
              from the images in the moodboard that I felt best represented the
              look and feel that I wanted associated with Scent, and then picked
              up my pencil and started sketching.

            <p>
              This process led me coming up with the idea of a rose coming out
              of a perfume flacon, with the stem being where the bottle’s
              cylinder is usually located. Once happy with my sketch, I created
              the finalized logo in Illustrator, which can be seen in the image
              below.
            </p>
            <div class="row text-center">

            <p>
              I opted to keep the nozzle lid incorporated into the ‘Scent’ text,
              but I did rework the font choice, instead this time opting for
              Proxima Nova. This typeface is one that lends itself very well to
              legibility, meaning it could be used as the main typography for
              Scent, but also has a nice modern feel to it, helping to promote
              the energetic, technology side of the Scent Brand. Purple was kept
              as the primary colour, helping to assimilate with the regal and
              affluent branding styles of many fragrances, but also being just
              vibrant enough to not lose sight of the modern tech feel that
              Scent looks to establish. Overall, I felt this Logo was a far
              stronger image for the company, and one that I was happy to
              progress with.

              As previously mentioned, it was when first attempting to create
              the Brand Guidelines with the old Scent Logo that I ultimately
              came to the conclusion that a redesign was imperative. When
              attempting to create an exclusion zone mapping for the logo, I
              realized that I had gone about things the wrong way. I created the
              logo, and the afterwards was checking the measurements of
              everything, rather than creating it first and foremost with the
              exclusion zones in mind. Now that I had the basis of the new logo
              created in Illustrator and ready to go, I set an artboard of 400px
              x 400px and mapped out everything in a symmetrical and even
              manner, which resulted in the image below.

          Proxima Nova I decided to use not only as the typeface of choice for
          the Scent Logo, but also as the default font family for all Scent
          related documentation, communications, and applications. The only
          exception to this rule is for the iOS app, where the default typeface
          is SF Pro, the new system font released by Apple in iOS 11.
        </p>

        <p>
          Proxima Nova works really well as the main typography for Scent due to
          the proportions, spacing, and overall look and feel, which contribute
          to a simple and clear typeface. With the use of open, circular forms,
          Proxima Nova doesn’t have a lot of fussy details or mannerisms,
          helping to provide a friendly appearance that is inline with the Brand
          Image of Scent. We want an image that is exuberant and stylish, but
          also isn’t so loud that it clashes with the thousands of brand images
          that we will encounter in the fragrance world. That is a very
          difficult position to balance, but Proxima Nova helps Scent massively
          in this regard.
        </p>

        <h1 class="header">Colour</h1>
        <p>
          Purple was chosen as the primary colour for Scent, due to its
          creative, imaginative and wise connotations (Miah, 2018). It’s also
          the colour most strongly associated with royalty, and as fragrances
          and perfumes were historically reserved for the aristocrats, it was
          the obvious choice when searching for the primary brand colour for an
          application like Scent. The purple chosen for Scent I believe
          perfectly represents the bright and creative technology nature of the
          brand, but also the classic and knowledgeable fragrance enthusiasts at
          our core. It does all this in a similar manner to our typography of
          choice, Proxima Nova, in that it promotes our Brand Image without
          dominating or clashing with the thousands of perfumes and colognes
          within our app.

          The secondary colours shown above were derived from the moodboard
          consisting of the different ingredient types most commonly used in the
          composition of perfumes and colognes. These secondary colours are
          primarly reserved for placeholders such as cards, where a gradient is
          applied as a background to displaying a fragrance or a user’s avatar.
          Examples of these can be seen below.

              I first sketched out the Wireframe using InVision’s Freehand tool,
              which allows you to quickly put together low-fi screens and get
              the general layout of the application in place. Once happy with
              this, I moved onto Photoshop.
            </p>
            <p>
              The User Story for the purpose of this deliverable is for a user
              to identify a fragrance that they would like to know more about,
              take a photo of it, read the basic info and then check out some of
              the reviews. From this, I identified the four screens that I
              required:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Landing Screen</li>
              <li>Photo/Scan Screen</li>
              <li>Results/Info Screen</li>
              <li>Reviews Screen</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For the bottom tabs, I decided upon the following menu items.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Home</li>
              <li>Search</li>
              <li>Camera</li>
              <li>Notifications</li>
              <li>Profile</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Using flaticon, I downloaded the .psd file for all but the Camera
              icon, converted it to a white colour fill, and imported the icon
              into the relevant location. For the Camera icon, I decided to
              create the icon myself using Illustrator, due to its importance in
              the user story and the overall user experience of Scent. This icon
              needed to be extremely obvious and accessible to the user, hence
              it being at the center and of a greater size to the other
              accompanying icons.
            </p>
            <p>
              Again, to drive user engagement, I opted for a ‘Recommended For
              You’ section, and also an editable ‘Your Favourite’, section,
              which allows users to set their Top 5 Fragrances.
